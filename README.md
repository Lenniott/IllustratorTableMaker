Makes tables from CSV file or filler text

This is my first time sharing a program I have written.

Saving presets will create a txt file and folder in the documentts folder of the user containting a new line for each input saved.

Use CSV files or create from scratch.

Editing the cells size can be a bit glitchy:

Resizing a cells width will adjust all widths for that column, its hight will auto adjust with the amount of text in the text box.

Resize width FROM THE RIGHT SIDE not the left.

Table creation UI is a dialog window so you are unable to click out of the UI without closing the window.

Edit table window is a panel window which allows clickablness outside of the window.

I have made a video here to show some functionality https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HDY3C3Sww8
